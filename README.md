# dbflow Feedback and Community

Welcome to the official community feedback repository for [dbflow](https://dbflow.io)! This is the best place to report bugs, request new features, and provide feedback to help us improve the application.

## How to Contribute

We use GitHub Issues to track all feedback. This is the primary way to get in touch with the development team.

-   **Request a Feature:** Have a great idea for a new feature? We'd love to hear it. Please [submit a feature request](https://github.com/tbson/dbflow-feedback/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+).
-   **General Feedback & Questions:** For general feedback, questions, or discussions, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/tbson/dbflow-feedback/issues/new).

Before creating a new issue, please search the existing issues to see if your feedback has already been reported.

## What to Expect
